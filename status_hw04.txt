I tried my best and followed all the instructions in lecture, but it just would not work ): I worked on this assignment for many, many hours but many parts were unclear.
Returning and printing the answer was not working. 
I attended lecture and took notes and deploying, but even then I had so many issues.

Not that comfortable; I still do not understand some parts. 
I do not understand the syntax of Elixir and what is "allowed".
